# DataMining
Data Mining and Machine Learning Techniques using Jupyter Notebook and Python3. :snake:

This particular Repository includes 3 folders.  
Each folder is a unique project by its own, including among others some Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques.


 ##    Project1:


In this Project, we were asked to kind of "play" with the given data, and we practiced more our __Data Mining skills__. To be more specific, we had 3 csv files, and we had to merge them together and sculpt them properly , in order to extract some useful data about some Airbnb apartments. 

## Project2:

In the next Project, we took a step deeper into the __Machine Learning techniques__.  
More specifically, we learned to use some classification methods, such as:
*   [Support Vector Machines](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)  
*   [Random Forests](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#)  
*   [Naive Bayes](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html)  
*   [K-Nearest Neighbor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html)  

Also, it must to be mentioned that the classification was implemented on differents text representations, such as:

*   [BoW (Bag of Words)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-bag-words-model/)  
*   [Tf-idf](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/what-is-tf-idf/)

Last but not least, we were asked to evaluate the accuracy of each method, using __10-Fold Cross Validation__, and also we did some Clustering to our data.

## FinalProject:

In the final Project, we did some of the things that we did in the previous Projects, such as cleaning and sclupting the data, but also we tried to optimize the scores of some classification models, i.e Naive Bayes.
